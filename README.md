# Bulls-And-Cows-Game
Bulls and Cows is a classic code-breaking game played between two players or one player and a computer. One player thinks of a secret number, typically a 4-digit number with all digits different, and the other tries to guess it. After each guess, the guesser receives feedback in the form of "bulls" and "cows." A bull means a correct digit in the correct position, while a cow means a correct digit in the wrong position. The goal is to deduce the secret number in as few guesses as possible using logical reasoning based on the feedback.
